Deposit feature

-------------------------------------

make upload form

allow admin to see form and change from pending to "Accepted or Rejected"
if accepted then add transaction details to database


model

User_Requests()
type : Deposit/Withdraw
amount : int
Reference : Random string
date : date of transaction (yyy/mm/dd)
Status : Pending/Completed/Rejected

how it'll work:

user clicks deposit 
random string reference generated and displayed to user
user makes the transfer using the given reference.
User enters the amount transfered, their reference and uploads proof of payment.
user presses submit and info saved to db User_Requests
files uploaded to folder media yy/mm (using date filed) with reference as name

admin loggs in
admin is shown all User_Requests with status "Pending"
admin checks the details and if everything is fine and reflects in the account then changes status to accepted
when admin changes status to accepted save transaction to table "Fiat_Transactions" with the following fields from transaction_type mapping to User_Requests()
date = date
amount = amount
transaction_type = type
notes = reference


* later allow user to view status of their transactions
